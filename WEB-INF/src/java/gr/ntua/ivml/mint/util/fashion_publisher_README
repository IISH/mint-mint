# Instructions to export FashionPublisher script as a jar and excetute it.
# This script is used to publish records to OAI database.
# 
# 1. Export as a jar from eclipse environment
#
# Right click on WEB-INF/src/java folder and select export. Choose 'as JAR'
# from the menu. On the pop up dialog choose only folder WEB-INF/sr/java. 
# Give name of your jar file and press 'Finish'. The jar file will be created
# at the directory you have specified.
#
# 2. Update the jar file
#
# Probably you will have to update some files (e.g. properties) inside the jara file.
# Usually these are hibernate.properties (mint postgrss database) and
# custom.properties (mysql source database). Edit your properties files, place the at
# the same directory with the jar and excecute:
#
# jar uf <name_of_the_jar.jar> hibernate.properties custom.properties
#
# 3. Set up script environment
#
# Probably you will have to move the script to another machine and run it.
# To run the script you need <name_of_the_jar.jar> and all jar files 
# included in 'WEB-INF/lib/' directory.
# You also need  directory 'schemas/' at the same path you excecute 
# the script. You can copy this directory from the root folder of mint2/ folder.
#
# 4. Running the script
#
# As for the first argument you need to give the path of directory 'xsl'
# as for the second one just make a new directory and use that path. If 
# you are running the script more than once you can use the director you 
# have created the previous time.
# Thrird argument is boolean value (true/false) which specifies if the =
# script will publish data apart from validate and transform.
# Forth parameters specifies how many records you want to publish from
# each organization. Use value -1 to publish all of them.
# Every other parameter is used to specify which organizations you want to 
# exclude from this process. Use oranization_id to sepcify the org.
#
# 5. Example of usage
#
# This will publish all records from all orgs except organization with org_id 1020
#
# java -cp fashionPublisher.jar:lib/* gr.ntua.ivml.mint.util.FashionPublisher xsl/
# xml/ true -1 1020
